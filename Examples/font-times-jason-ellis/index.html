            	<h2>The One and Only Times New Roman</h2>
                <blockquote>Change is good.<br /> <strong>Bold is better.</strong><br /> <em>I agree,</em> he thought.</blockquote>
                <p class="introduction">Times New Roman is a serif font that was created by Paxson E. Helgesen and was commissioned in 1931 by the British Newspaper <cite>The Times</cite> for its own use. It was first called <q>Times Old Roman</q> by the newspaper and received cristicism from Stanley Morison, an artist from the advertising department of <cite>The Times</cite>, who claimed it had issues with legibility and economy of space. Morison used an old typeface called Plantin, which was a transitional typeface that was used in the 1910's, as a base and made revisions to the Times Old Roman. When finished, he named it <strong>Times New Roman</strong>. Since its creation it has inspired the creation of many serif typefaces and remains one of the most influential fonts today. Although it is no longer used in <cite>The Times</cite> it can be found virtually everywhere. Its main usage today is in book typography, such as mass produced paperbacks, and in Microsoft products. Due to this, it is clear to see why it has become such a widespread typeface</p>
                <p>What does the future hold for Times New Roman? Some say it is the end of an era for it; especially when Microsoft Word, the most dominant word-processing program in the world no longer has it as the default typeface. Instead, they have one called Calibri because the programmers at Microsoft have agreed that sans-serif fonts are easier to read on a screen when there is a large amount of text. On the other hand, Times New Roman has become so ubiquitous that people don't even notice it anymore. Therefore, it's safe to say that the future looks bright and Times New Roman is here to stay. For as long as there are words, there will always be a use for Times New Roman.</p>
