            	<h3>So the story goes</h3>
            	<p><q>Hey, Vincent!  Wait up.</q> under heavy breath Mark asks Vincent if he is going for lunch, and with a smirk Vincent replies <q>Yeah, the cafeteria okay for you?</q> Mark nods his head yes <q>Good your buying,</q> says Vincent, putting his wallet back in his pocket and the two made their way down to the cafe. </p> 

				<p>The cafe was a dull grey room with six rows of tables, each five tables deep and found above them, matching florescent lighting.  A few of the lights flicker, but they all hummed. It was the typical Wednesday lunch rush and Mark and Vincent took their queue seven positions back from the front runner who was making a fuss about the portions he was receiving. The feud might have lasted longer but someone piped up and yelled <q>Mike move it along we only got fifteen minutes today, Larson wants us back to go over those flowcharts,</q> and with that Mike smiled at Marg the service lady and moved on.</p>   

				<p><q>Hey Vincent, you ever get any of those internet puzzle emails?</q> asks Mark, pointing to the roast beef sandwiches. Vincent replies <q>No, why?</q> Mark continues <q>I got this one yesterday about those old medieval missile launcher things... you know the <em>Trebuchets</em>.</q> <q>Trebu-whats</q> says Vincent. Mark continues again <q><em>Trebuchets</em>, like giant catapults. Anyways, the question was can you make a <em>Trebuchet</em> that could launch a person from main campus to the new consumer campus about a mile away? I mean mathematically it is...</q>  <q>That's it!</q> blurts Vincent, abruptly cutting of Mark, <q>that's the name for the new font we've been working on, <em>Trebuchet</em>, it going to be the font that launches words across the internet.</q></p>
                
				<p>The above story is based on true events. Vincent Connare came up with the name for <em>Trebuchet</em> font from a lunch conversation with someone from his type group. For all I know it really could have been Mark!</p>
                
                <h3>The Details</h3>
                <p>Vincent Connare wanted to create a font where it's main goal was not to match Verdana or MS Sans but highlight certain nuances. <em>Trebuchet</em> is available on both MAC and PC systems and has been considered one of the most distinctive common web fonts today. The beauty of it's design comes from its increase in legibility at smaller sizes.</p>

                            <td>Trebuchet, designed by Vincent Connare in 1996, is a humanist sans serif designed for easy screen readability. Trebuchet takes its inspiration from the sans serifs of the 1930s which had large x heights and round features intended to promote readability on signs. The typeface name is credited to a puzzle heard at Microsoft, where the question was asked, "could you build a Trebuchet (a form of medieval catapult) to launch a person from the main campus to the consumer campus, and how?" The Trebuchet fonts are intended to be the vehicle that fires your messages across the Internet. "Launch your message with a Trebuchet page".</td>
