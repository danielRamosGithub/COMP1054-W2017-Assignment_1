                <h3>Lucida Family</h3>
                <p>Lucida is an extended family of related typefaces designed by Charles Bigelow and Kris Holmes in 1985. The family are intended to be extremely legible when printed at small size or displayed on a low-resolution display - hence the name, from 'lucid' (clear or easy to understand). </p>
                <p>There are many variants of Lucida, including serif (Fax, Bright), sans-serif (<em>Sans</em>, Sans Unicode, Grande, Sans Typewriter) and scripts (Blackletter, Calligraphy, Handwriting). Many are released with other software, most notably Microsoft Office.</p>

                <h3>Lucida Sans Font</h3>
                <p><strong>Lucida Sans</strong> is the sans serif complement Lucida. The strong shapes and generous proportions are based on traditional Roman letterforms, making them clear and easy to read in the fine print of directories and parts lists, as well as clean and powerful in business correspondence and newsletters. </p>
